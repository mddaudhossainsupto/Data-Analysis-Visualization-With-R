The "Iris problem" typically refers to a well-known machine learning problem that involves classifying iris flowers into different species based on measurements of their floral parts. This problem is often used as a beginner-level classification task in the field of machine learning.
Iris.CSV is providing the dataset in this project.

Loading the Dataset:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using the read.csv() function, specifying the file path, header, and separator.
Data Preprocessing:

Renaming columns: 

Column names are renamed to standardize them.
Converting to factors: Selected columns (SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth) are converted to factors using the lapply() function.
Handling missing values: Missing values in numeric columns are imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method from the zoo package.

Feature Selection:

Statistical testing:

Features with significant associations with the target variable (Class) are identified using a chi-square test. Features with a p-value less than 0.05 are selected for model training.

Model Training:

Naive Bayes model: 

A Naive Bayes classification model is trained using the selected features (s_attributes) and the target variable (Class).
Train-test split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split ratio.

Model Evaluation:

Prediction accuracy: 

The accuracy of the trained Naive Bayes model is evaluated on the test set using the predictAccuracy() function. The proportion of correctly predicted instances is calculated.
Cross-validation: Cross-validation accuracy is computed using the crossValidationAccuracy() function with 10-fold cross-validation.

Confusion matrix: 

A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance across different classes.
Precision, recall, and F-measure: Precision, recall, and F-measure scores are computed from the confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance for each class.

Output and Reporting:

Accuracy metrics: 

The accuracy of the model on the test set and during cross-validation, along with precision, recall, and F-measure scores for each class, are printed as output.
Reporting: The results are reported as a classification report, providing insights into the model's performance for each class.

Functionality Description:

Model Training: Train a Naive Bayes model on the Iris dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set and through cross-validation.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features based on statistical significance.
Output Reporting: Report accuracy metrics and classification results for model evaluation.
